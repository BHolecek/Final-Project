        <p>Kansas has begun the phases in order to try and reopen the state during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will take time, though. Restaurants are still hardly functioning. In addition, many businesses are still prefering that employees work from home.</p>

        <p>In my hometown of Ellsworth, many restaurants are still functioning via curbside pickup. We have seen the golf course uplift many restrictions. The flags are back in the cups on the green. We have seen the clubhouse sell more miscellaneous items the last few days too. With this update, many people are starting to play rounds of golf with friends once again. We just saw our first confirmed case early this week, however. The person has not seen any symptoms surface, but we hope the restrictions can continue to be uplifted.</p>
